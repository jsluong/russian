Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection with Matrix Manipulation

Given the digitized glass plates from Prokudin-Gorskii's project to document Russia in color—each set containing a scene taken through a red, green, and blue filter—we attempt to algorithmically align and render each set into a color image.

To do this, we perform a number of matrix operations with NumPy and SciPy to generate the final image.
